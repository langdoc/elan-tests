    "## ELAN tests\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the ELAN file validation tests used in IKDP research project, and it's continuation project [Language Documentation meets Language Technology: The Next Step in the Description of Komi](https://langdoc.github.io/IKDP-2/). Some parts of the code is very old, some is never, and with some parts the final implementation is still being thought about. Especially with tests that interact between ELAN files and metadata there are countless ways to do them effectively, and the current method is probably not the final. Similarly, it is still bit unclear what is the best way to store project's common attributes. Currently we are using a YAML file called `project.yaml`, but there are maybe other better alternatives to that. The idea is that in principle the methods could be adapted into other projects by editing this configuration file. In practice this may be more complicated."

Second, each participant in ELAN file should be present in the right place within the metadata.
