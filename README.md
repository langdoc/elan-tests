## Language documentation corpus validation scripts

This repository contains a series of scripts that can be used to validate and investigate the structural coherence of a language documentation corpus that has been stored as ELAN files. 

The scripts have been built to work with the structure of ELAN tier template used in several research projects, including [IKDP](https://langdoc.github.io/IKDP/), in the continuation project of which, [IKDP-2](https://langdoc.github.io/IKDP-2/) this work has been carried out. 

[This notebook](./elan_tests.ipynb) illustrates how the scripts can be used. Eventually some example should be taken from unit testing in software, which would make it easier to use continuous integration and other tools.
